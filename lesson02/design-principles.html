                Google is a classic example of Hick's Law. Hick's Law can be applied to optimize the presentation 
                of choices and information to enhance the overall user experience. Google's homepage is a classic 
                example of simplicity and minimalism. The main focus is on the search bar, keeping choices to a 
                minimum. Users can quickly perform a search without distractions.

            <p>
                YouTube is a great exemple of Fitt's Law. Fitts's Law is a principle in human-computer interaction 
                and ergonomics that predicts the time required to rapidly move to a target area, like a button or 
                a link, based on the size of the target and the distance to it. Youtube video screen use the Fitts's Law
                by making the play button for the featured video largeand central. This prime location and ample 
                size make it easy for users to tap and start watching,minimizing the time and effort required to 
                reach the desired action.

                Apple is an exemple of Rule of Thirds. It involves dividing an image or design into a grid of 
                equal parts. The key elements or points of interest are then placed along these lines or at their 
                intersections.Apple's mobile product pages utilize the Rule of Thirds by prominently displaying
                the hero imagein two-thirds of the screen, off-center to add dynamism. The key features and call 
                to action are then positioned at the intersections of the thirds, drawing the user's eye to the 
                most important information and action point.
