            <p>
                Spotify's mobile homepage exemplifies Hick's Law by keeping the navigation options limited and clear.
                The five large, labeled icons in the top bar make it easy for users to find what they need without
                being overwhelmed by too many choices. This reduces decision fatigue and improves user experience.

            <p>
                YouTube's mobile homepage applies Fitt's Law by making the play button for the featured video large
                and central. This prime location and ample size make it easy for users to tap and start watching,
                minimizing the time and effort required to reach the desired action.

            <p>
                Apple's mobile product pages utilize the Rule of Thirds by prominently displaying the hero image
                in two-thirds of the screen, off-center to add dynamism. The key features and call to action are then
                positioned at the intersections of the thirds, drawing the user's eye to the most important information
                and action point.
